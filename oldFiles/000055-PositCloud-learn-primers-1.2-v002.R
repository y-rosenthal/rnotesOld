#######################################################
#######################################################

# https://posit.cloud hosts an online version of the RStudio program.
# You can get started simply with the "free" plan. 
# It should be pretty easy to figure out how to do that 
# by navigating to https://posit.cloud

# When you login to posit.cloud you should create a "New RStudio Project".
# You can then use that project for all of your R work.

# posit.cloud also has several tutorials (i.e. "primers").
# You can get to these by clicking the "primers" button.
# The first primer is called "The Basics".
# "The Basics" primer is divided into "Visualization Basics"
# and "Programming Basics".
# This class will focus on programming, not visualization.

# The code below is adapted from the "Programming Basics"
# section of "The Basics" primer on posit.cloud.
# Feel free to use the code below to practice what 
# you learned by going through this material.


##------------------------------------------------------.
## Note that instead of using Posit.cloud you could 
## also/instead install R and RStudio on your computer.
##------------------------------------------------------.
## How to install R and RStudio
## See this for an interactive tutorial:
## https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-install-r
## The basic info is below

# STEP 1
#
# Install R from here
# cloud.r-project.org

# STEP 2 - You MUST do STEP 1 first
# Install RStudio from here
# www.rstudio.com

# The instructions in the interactive tutorial describe how to \
# install "packages".
# We will not be installing packages yet.

# Arguments (also known as Parameters)
########################################

Sys.Date()  # CAPITAL "S" and CAPITAL "D"
# The above function has no "arguments" - just parentheses after the function name

paste("Hello", "World", "!", sep=" ")
# The above function has more than one "argument" 


log(100, 10)    
# Returns:
#   2

log(10, 100)
# Returns
#   0.5

args(log)
# Returns: 
#   function (x, base = exp(1)) 
#   NULL
#
# In the output above the = sign after base means
# that base is optional. exp(1) is R's way of writing
# the special number "e" in math.

log(100)   # x is 100, base is exp(1)
log(x = 100, base = exp(1))   # same result
log(base = exp(1), x = 100)   # same result


log(x=100, base=10)   # you can specify argument names
# Returns:
#   2




# QUESTION (from prof rosenthal):
#   Explore the round function.
#
#     How many arguments does it take?
#
#     What are their names?
#
#     Show three different ways of writing code to round the value x to the 
#     nearest tenth (i.e. 6.37 would be 6.4 but 6.32 would be 6.3)
#
#     What is the shortest way to write code that rounds the value x to the
#     nearest whole number?  (i.e. 4.9342 would be 5)
#

# QUESTION (from prof rosenthal)
#     What's wrong with the following code? It was intended to generate
#     five random numbers that are each between 10 and 20.
#     Fix the code so that works correctly.
runif(5, largest=20, smallest=10 )


# QUESTION (from prof rosenthal):
#   What are the arguments of the runif function?
#
#   Which arguments are optional?
#
#   Use runif to generate 100 random values that are between 100 and 105



# QUESTION (from the website):
#   What are the arguments of the rnorm function?
#
#   Which arguments are optional?
#
#   Use rnrom() to generate 100 random normal values with a mean of 100 and
#   a standard deviation of 15.

runif(1)    # one number

runif(10)   # ten numbers

c(89, 75, 92)  # a vector of 3 specific numbers

c(test1=82, test2=93, homework=85 )  # a vector with "names"

nums <- c(3,2,5)

sum(nums)        # 10

mean(nums)       # 3.333

factorial(nums)  # 6 2 120 - one answer for each value in nums - this is a "vectorized" function




# QUESTION
# Create a vector that contains the integers from one to ten.



#------------------------------------------------.
# Using the colon operator (e.g.  3:7)
#------------------------------------------------.
#
# If your vector contains a sequence of contiguous integers, you can create 
# it with the : shortcut. Run 1:10 . What do you get? 
# What do you suppose 1:20 would return?


someNumbers <- c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16)

# QUESTION
# You can extract any element of a vector by placing a pair of brackets behind
# the vector. Inside the brackets place the number of the element that youâ€™d
# like to extract. For example, someNumbers[3] would return the third element of 
# the vector named someNumbers
#
# Write code to extract the fourth element of someNumbers


#------------------------------------------------.
# Extracting specific values by using [square brackets]
#------------------------------------------------.

# You can also use [] to extract multiple elements of a vector.
# Place the vector c(1,2,5) between the brackets below. What does R return?

vec <- c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
vec[]




#------------------------------------------------.
# Extracting specific values by using argument names
#------------------------------------------------.

# If the elements of your vector have names, you can extract them by name. 
# To do so place a name or vector of names in the brackets behind a vector. 
# Surround each name with quotation marks, e.g. vec2[c("alpha", "beta")].

# Extract the element named gamma from the vector below.
vec2 <- c(alpha = 1, beta = 2, gamma = 3)

# Predict what the code below will return. Then look at the result.

# Predict what the code below will return. Then look at the result.
1 + c(10, 20, 30, 40)

typeof(c(1,2,3.14))   # double

typeof(c(1,2,3))      # also double

typeof(c(1L, 2L, 3L)) # integer

typeof(c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))  # logical

# Other types that are beyond the scope of this course
# are: complex and raw

# mode is similar to typeof (but not exactly the same)

mode(fruit)         # character

mode(nums)          # numeric

mode(c(1,2,3.14))   # numeric

mode(c(1,2,3))      # numeric

mode(c(1L, 2L, 3L)) # numeric

mode(c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE))  # logical

#------------------------------------------
# Only ONE type to a vector
#------------------------------------------

# Vectors may only contain a single type. 
# Otherwise values are "coerced" to a single type.
c(1, TRUE, "hello")
typeof( c(1, TRUE, "hello") )   # character

# Floating point arithmetic and roundoff errors
#-----------------------------------------------------

# Why does R contain both integer and double data types? 

# You may have heard of the term "binary numbers". Without going into too 
# much detail now, this has to do with the way computers work internally.
# Internally, computers store numbers in a different way than most people 
# are used to. Instead of storing the number 5, internally, the number 5
# is actually stored as 00000101. There are reasons for this but for now, 
# just realize that computers store numbers internally differently than 
# people do. When the computer displays the number that is stored internally
# as 00000101 it displays it as 5. This whole system gets a little complicated.
# For example, numbers with decimal points are stored using a different 
# technique than integers are.

# Computers must use a finite amount of memory to store decimal numbers (which
# can sometimes require infinite precision). As a result, some decimals can only
# be saved as very precise approximations. From time to time youâ€™ll notice side
# effects of this imprecision, like below.

#   Compute the square root of two,square the answer (e.g. multiply the square 
#   root of two by the square root of two), and then subtract two from the result. 
#   What answer do you expect? What answer do you get?

sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) - 2  # you'd expect 0 but you get: 4.440892e-16
  
# If you use data that has a typeof integer (e.g. 2L) you will not be able to 
# work with decimal points but you will not get these roundoff errors.
# However, if you want to use decimal points then you will have to realize
# that occasionally you may get some roundoff error. We may discuss in a future
# class why this happens and what you can do to avoid it from happening.



# QUESTION
# 
# Create a vector of integers from one to five. 
# Can you imagine why you might want to use integers instead of numbers/doubles?
#
# Create a vector of integers from one to five hundred.
