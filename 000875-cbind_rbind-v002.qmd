# cbind and rbind (to combine dataframes)

```{r}
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# cbind and rbind functions
#
# cbind combines (i.e. "binds") columns from multiple dataframes, matrices and vectors.
# rbind combines (i.e. "binds") columns from multiple dataframes, matrices and vectors.
#
# For both cbind and rbind
#   - If all items being "bound" are vectors and matrices then the result is a matrix.
#   - If any of the items being "bound" is a dataframe, the result is a dataframe.
