# In general, DO NOT use parentheses when they are clearly not necessary. ####
# It shows poor knowledge of the R language. 
#####################################################################.

# Don't do this! - you never need parentheses around a single value
seq((1), (3))  

# Don't do this! - unnecessary parentheses
(seq(1,3))   

# Don't do this! - you never need parentheses around a single argument
x=2
seq(1,(3+x))  # do not put parentheses around a single argument

# This is the way to do it.
seq(1 , 3+x)  # better!


#####################################################################.
# It is acceptable to use extra parentheses when they are used to 
# clarify the order of operations. Not everyone knows the order of 
# operations by heart and this can make your code more readable.
#####################################################################.

# For example:

10-(2:10)

# is very different from 

(10-2):10

# The following (without the parentheses)
10-2:10

# is the same as 10-(2:10) as the order of operations lists the
# colon operator (:) before the subtraction operator (-)
# ( see ?Syntax )
#
# Therefore, I'd accept 10-(2:10) even thought strictly speaking the 
# parentheses are not necessary as the parentheses help to clarify the
# order of operations.

# QUESTION: The vector, x, contains at lest 3 values.
#           Write a command to show the last 3 values in the vector.
#           Your code must work no matter how many values are in the vector.
#
# Example 1: 
#   > x = c("anne","bob","carla","dave","ed","fran","george","hugh","ike","jill")
#   YOUR CODE GOES HERE
#   [1] "hugh" "ike" "jill"
#
# Example 2: 
#   > x = seq(10,50,by=10)
#   YOUR CODE GOES HERE
#   [1] 30 40 50

#------------.
# Answer: 
#------------.

# Example 1:
x = c("anne","bob","carla","dave","ed","fran","george","hugh","ike","jill")
x[ (length(x)-2):length(x) ]    # ANSWER

# Example 2: 
x = seq(10,50,by=10)
x[ (length(x)-2):length(x) ]    # ANSWER

# Don't use c(...) when it is not necessary  ####
#####################################################################.

# c() is only required to combine multiple vectors into a single vector.
# Do not use c for a single vector.

students = c("joe", "sue")   # c is required
c(students)     # c is not required - since there is only one vector - dont use c here
students


c(seq(1,10,by=2))  # c is not required because seq is already a vector! - don't use c here
seq(1,10,by=2)

c ( rep(10,3), rep(20, 2))  # c IS required because you're combining two different vectors
```
