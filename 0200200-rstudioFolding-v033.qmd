#### How to hide/show portions of code in RStudio (i.e. "code folding") ####
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Using RStudio's editor, you can hide/show certain portions of code.
# This makes it is easier to navigate through long code files.
# Hiding code in the editor in this way is called "code folding".
#
# To fold code you can
# click on the triangles   ####
# that appear in RStudio's margin, next to the line numbers.
# These triangles appear in the following places:
#
#   1. Next to the first line of a function                        ####
#   2. Next to the line that contains a opening "{"                ####
#   3. on a line with a comment that ends with 4 pound signs, i.e. ####
#   4. on a line with a comment that ends with 4 equal signs, i.e. ====
#   5. on a line with a comment that ends with 4 dashes, i.e.      ----
#
# 
# #### Hot Keys and Menu choices ####
# 
# You can fold a particular section of code or all sections with the 
# menu choices found under "Edit | Folding" menu. These choices have the
# following corresponding hotkeys.
#
#   - collapse a single section   (Windows: alt+L)        ####
#   - expand a single section     (Windows: alt+shift+L)  ####
#   - collapse ALL sections       (Windows: alt+O)        ####
#   - expand ALL sections         (Windows: alt+shift+O)  ####
